# Simple Image Classification With Neural Networks

## Approaches:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
- Transfer learning (optional, if pre-trained models are used)

## Libraries and Frameworks:
- TensorFlow and Keras (for building and training the CNN model)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for visualizing images)
- OpenCV (for image loading and preprocessing)

## Procedure:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using `keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()`
   - Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1]
   - Define class names for interpretation

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
   - Display a grid of sample images from the training set along with their class labels

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets

4. **Model Building**:
   - Define a sequential CNN model using `keras.models.Sequential()`
   - Add convolutional layers with ReLU activation (`keras.layers.Conv2D`)
   - Add max pooling layers for downsampling (`keras.layers.MaxPooling2D`)
   - Add a flattening layer to convert the 2D feature maps to 1D vectors
   - Add dense layers with ReLU activation (`keras.layers.Dense`)
   - Add an output dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification

5. **Model Compilation and Training**:
   - Compile the model with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., sparse categorical cross-entropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy)
   - Train the model using the `model.fit()` function, passing the training data and specifying the number of epochs

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing data using `model.evaluate()`
   - Print the loss and accuracy metrics

7. **Model Saving and Loading**:
   - Save the trained model to disk using `model.save()`
   - Demonstrate how to load the saved model using `keras.models.load_model()`

8. **Making Predictions on New Images**:
   - Load images from a directory
   - Preprocess the images (e.g., resize, normalize)
   - Use the loaded model to make predictions on the new images
   - Print the predicted class labels

## Conclusion:
The code provides a solution for image classification tasks using a CNN model. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of loading a dataset, building and training a CNN model, evaluating its performance, saving and loading the model, and making predictions on new images. The solution can be further extended or customized based on specific requirements, such as using pre-trained models for transfer learning, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or deploying the model for inference.
